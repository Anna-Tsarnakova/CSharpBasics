Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences

C# is a programming language, .NET is the framework that the language is built on. Framework means it contained different applications.
.NET Framework is a software framework that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language 
which can run on the CLR, can also use the .NET libraries.  It includes a large library and provides language interoperability across several
programming languages. C# is just a program language like C, C++, Java, PHP, ect. with specific syntax. Microsoft's implementation of C# is 
integrated with the .NET Framework. It is very difficult to use Microsoft's implementation of C# without using the .NET framework
